## Edgar O. Castro Mendez

I am an applied Micro-economist with research interests in public economics and market interventions. Specifically, I investigate the role of price distorticons on consumer hoarding behavior, the impacts of relaxation of procurement rules in Latin America and the impact of tax amnesties in Argentina. I use laboratory experiments, or field experiments, as well as observational data to provide insights and policy implications for the real world.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics from the Interdisciplinary Center for Economic Science at George Mason University.
