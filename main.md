## Edgar O. Castro Mendez

I am an applied micro-economist specializing in public economics and market interventions. My research delves into the influence of price distortions on consumer hoarding behaviors, the consequences of relaxing procurement regulations in Latin America, and the effects of tax amnesties in Argentina. I employ laboratory and field experiments, alongside observational data, to provide insights and draw policy implications for real-world scenarios.

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics from the Interdisciplinary Center for Economic Science at George Mason University.
